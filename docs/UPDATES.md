# 🔍 Chat Search UI

## ✨ **New Feature: Modern Search Bar**
I have upgraded the simplistic search button to a full-featured Search Bar UI.

### 🎨 **Visual Updates:**
1.  **Split Header Layout**:
    *   **Title**: "Messages" stands bold and clear at the top.
    *   **Search**: A distinct, pill-shaped search box sits below it.
2.  **Minimalistic Design**:
    *   Clean white input on cream background.
    *   Subtle shadow for depth.
    *   Consistently colored placeholders.
3.  **Better Spacing**: Added top padding to the list for a less cramped look.

## 🚀 **How to Test**
1.  **Go to Messages**.
2.  Observe the new **Header Layout**.
3.  See the **Search Bar** ("Search...").
4.  The list starts cleanly below it.

It looks much cleaner and user-friendly now! 🔍✨
